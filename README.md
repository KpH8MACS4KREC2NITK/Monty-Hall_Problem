ABSTRACT 

This research report presents a deep re-look at the classical Monty-Hall Problem, refuting the widely accepted position held by the leading subject-area-experts, and establishing that there is no rational basis for a switched choice in the decision to be made by the guest of the game show. 

Logical consistency requires that any conditionality used in the evaluation process cannot be lifted after the evaluation process, implementing the decision arrived at based on that very conditionality.
